# Starstuff Types

> ðŸš§ This is still a work in progress!!! ðŸš§

A simple star catalog parser and primitive types for star coordinates and astronomical times.

> Note: currently supports the [Yale Bright Stars Catalog](http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/catalogs/bsc5.html),  the [Hipparcos Catalog](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/hipparcos.html), and the [Open Source Bright Star Catalog](https://github.com/johanley/star-catalog).
  Run the `get_data.sh` script to fetch the catalogs.

## Notes

- [Open Source Bright Star Catalog documentation](https://johanley.github.io/star-catalog/) is a very good summary of typical astronomical data and the challenges working with it.

# starmap

A simple star catalog parser and primitive structures for star coordinates.

> Note: currently supports the [Yale Bright Stars Catalog](http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/catalogs/bsc5.html) and the [Hipparcos Catalog](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/all/hipparcos.html).
  Run the `get_data.sh` script to fetch the catalogs.
